  Login
  To login into the MS SQLEXPRESS database server, you need a IP address or NAME PATH, user name and password. Else, set up correctly, you can use the operation services authentication.
  Once connection has been established, the Connect button is replaced by the Disconnect button.
  Being connect results in listboxes and other data aware controls to be populated with SwimClubMeet data.
  Clicking the disconnect button will log you out of the server and end the connection. Closing the application will also perform the same task.
